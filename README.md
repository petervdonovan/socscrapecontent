The purpose of this repository is to access Long Beach Unified School District sites and store data from those sites in Excel spreadsheets. Those spreadsheets were then to be uploaded to Google Sheets, where the same sites from which the data was pulled could dynamically access the data, even as it is being updated by teachers and school administrators. The JavaScript client-side software for those sites is included in the project [socfrontend](https://github.com/petervdonovan/socfrontend/). An intermediate step between the sheets generated here and the client-side software is documented in [mastersheet](https://github.com/petervdonovan/mastersheet).
